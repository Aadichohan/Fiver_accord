What underpins the success of this My Backyard Garden Project is that this is a 100% TEAM EFFORT. By this we mean we all help each other build a garden [either family or community] before moving on to the next. This characterises the cliche 'many hands make light work'.
		<br>
		<br>

		1,014 family/whanau, kindergarten, community, and special needs gardens built or supplied [including 1,368+ compost bins] by the growing TEAM since May 28th - 2016
		<br>

			<h3 style="">&nbsp;The 4 e's</h3>

		May 28th 2016 was the 'live' launch date of My Backyard Garden Project [mbgp] in West Auckland. The idea was to source FREE materials, i.e. topsoil, mulch, recyled timber [pallets, old fence palings, different sized timber] and make into raised garden beds and pallet compost bins.<br>
		<br>
		52 gardens later
		 we can inform that it was a 'determined bunch of single Mums' who saw the value of growing their own healthy nutritious vegetables that were the driving force of the projects success. Mums who have become dab hands at de-nailing recycled timber from the tip, who learn how to use a nail gun, dropsaw and many other shared skills associated with gardening.<br>
		<br>
		The 4 e's are a continuing live cycle within the project. People who join with little to no skills become sponges soaking up what we share and teach. Each garden they help with they contribute more and more which is a great morale boaster for them and the TEAM. <br>
		Empowerment is very much about: "Give a man a fish,  feed him for a day; teach a man to catch fish,  feed him for a lifetime"... and as we continue to build more gardens and see pictures of their gardens and harvest, it becomes evidently true.<br>

		                        There was a time when Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan had mastered the template of opening in ODIs. They set up to bat long with a sedate start as platform, and kept accelerating. Since they started opening together in the Champions Trophy in 2013, 12 pairs have batted together long enough to be able to aggregate 1000 or more runs together. Only opening pairs from Ireland and Scotland have gone slower than Dhawan and Rohit.<br />
		<br />
		There are reasons for it. Since 2015, India haven't had a great middle order, so the top three have had to prioritise the length of their partnerships over speed. Also they have had the bowlers to restrict the opposition, so they can argue they haven't needed to go quicker.<br />
		<br />
		Both of those contributing factors are changing. Which brings us to the second, a much more incredible stat. Shiva Jayaraman is our in-house genius who can put numbers to approach and intent. He did some digging and found this: since ESPNcricinfo started maintaining ball-by-ball records, there have been over 4000 instances of a team losing three wickets in the space of 60 balls when batting first in ODIs; only once has a team responded with more sixes in the next five overs than the four that India hit in this match in Pune.

		                     There was a time when Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan had mastered the template of opening in ODIs. They set up to bat long with a sedate start as platform, and kept accelerating. Since they started opening together in the Champions Trophy in 2013, 12 pairs have batted together long enough to be able to aggregate 1000 or more runs together. Only opening pairs from Ireland and Scotland have gone slower than Dhawan and Rohit.<br />
		<br />
		Bowling to him was another debutant: left-arm spinner Nasum Ahmed. Unlike Allen, he had moderate returns of 12 wickets from 27 T20s before this game. Opening the bowling, Nasum started with four dots to Guptill before miscued single brought Allen on strike. And voila, Nasum bowled Allen for a first-ball duck as the ball skidded through the gap between bat and bat and hit the top of the leg stump. Nasum had a wicket in his first over, Allen a first-ball duck. Nasum later dismissed Matin Guptill, caught at long-off for 27-ball 35, to finish with figures of 2 for 30.<br />
		<br />
		The other two debutants in the match had contrasting fortunes as well. Coming in at 53 for 2 in the seventh over, Young looked in no trouble against any bowler. Exhibiting a free flow of the arms, he hit two four and four sixes and brought up his fifty off just 28 balls as Conway and he took the game away from Bangladesh.

		                      <p>
		                      No stopping for Conway
		Before coming into this game, Conway had five scores of 50-plus in 12 international innings. There was no stopping for him once again as he showed his full range. Apart from playing proper cricketing shots, Conway didn't hesitate to charge down against seamers or reverse-sweep spinners.<br />
		<br />
		In the 15th over, Conway slog-swept Nasum towards deep-backward square leg, where Shoriful caught the ball right at the boundary. The fielder was confident his foot wasn't touching the boundary line but the third umpire couldn't spot any gap between his foot and the boundary skirting and ruled it a six. That took Conway to his fifty, off 37 deliveries.<br />
		<br />
		The two shots that stood out came in the final two overs. Saifuddin went full and wide in the 19th over. Conway went down on one knee and opened the face of the bat to launch it over point for six. Then in the final over, he reverse-scooped Mustafizur Rahman over short third man, with the ball almost carrying all the way. In all, he scored 47 runs behind the stumps.<br />
		<br />
		Bangladesh crumble in the chase
		It was the first time since 2006 that Bangladesh were playing an international match without Shakib Al Hasan, Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim, the latter missing out because of a shoulder injury. That left a void too big to fill as Bangladesh's batsmen crumbled against Sodhi.
